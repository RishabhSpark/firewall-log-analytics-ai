pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Setup Kaggle API (Required for dataset download)
```bash
# Option 1: Install kaggle package and setup API credentials
pip install kaggle
# Then place your kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/ directory

# Option 2: The notebook will prompt for Kaggle authentication if needed
```

### 5. Launch Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook

# Open analytics.ipynb in your browser
# Navigate to: http://localhost:8888
```

### 6. Run the Analysis
1. Open `analytics.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Run all cells sequentially (Cell â†’ Run All)
3. The notebook will:
   - Download the firewall dataset automatically
   - Perform data analysis and feature engineering
   - Train the anomaly detection model
   - Generate security dashboards

## Data Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- **Dataset**: Internet Firewall Data (log2.csv)
- **Features**: Source/Destination ports, bytes transferred, packets, elapsed time, actions
- **Size**: Variable based on dataset

### 2. Feature Engineering
The system creates advanced features for better anomaly detection:

- **Traffic Metrics**:
  - `Avg_Packet_Size`: Average bytes per packet
  - `Bytes_Per_Sec`: Bandwidth utilization rate
  - `Packets_Per_Sec`: Packet transmission rate

- **Behavioral Indicators**:
  - `Bytes_Sent_Ratio`: Ratio of sent to received bytes
  - `Packets_Sent_Ratio`: Ratio of sent to received packets
  - `Unidir_Outbound_Flag`: Identifies unidirectional outbound traffic (potential scanning)

### 3. Anomaly Detection Model
- **Algorithm**: Isolation Forest
- **Contamination Rate**: 1% (configurable)
- **Features**: 14 engineered features including traffic patterns and behavioral indicators
- **Output**: Anomaly scores and binary classifications

### 4. Dashboard Generation
Multi-level monitoring dashboard with:
- Traffic volume trends
- Security incident counts
- Top threat vectors
- Port-based analysis

## Model Performance

### Anomaly Detection
- **Model**: Isolation Forest with 100 estimators
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler normalization + One-hot encoding
- **Detection Rate**: Configurable contamination parameter (default: 1%)
- **Scoring**: Continuous anomaly scores for threat prioritization

### Key Metrics
- **Anomaly Score**: Lower scores indicate higher anomaly likelihood
- **Binary Classification**: -1 (anomaly) vs +1 (normal)
- **Feature Importance**: Based on isolation path lengths

## Dashboard Insights

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Traffic Analysis**: Bytes transferred over time
- **Error Tracking**: Denied/dropped connection attempts
- **Threat Detection**: Anomaly counts by time period

### Security Intelligence
- **Port Analysis**: Most frequently targeted ports
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Unidirectional traffic detection
- **Threat Prioritization**: Anomaly score-based ranking

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Model Parameters
```python
# Isolation Forest Configuration
contamination_rate = 0.01  # Expected anomaly percentage
n_estimators = 100         # Number of isolation trees
random_state = 42          # Reproducibility seed
```

### Feature Selection
The system automatically identifies and processes:
- Numerical features (continuous metrics)
- Categorical features (actions, protocols)
- Engineered features (derived metrics)
